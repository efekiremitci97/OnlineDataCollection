__Motivation__

1.1 
Crypto currencies are getting more and more popular lately. People increasingly start investing in it, and it gets a lot of attention in the news. This project aims to investigate the effect of global and crypto specific news on the prices of different types of crypto currencies. As crypto currencies are highly volatile, it is very interesting to investigate to what extent messages in the news can have an influence on this. The research question has a high practical relevance, as it provides not only traders but also policy makers with insights on how news affect the prices of crypto currencies. 

After considering multiple relevant websites and API's, we choose to make use of the API of coinmarketcap.com. This API fits our research question best, and provides good insights in the price fluctuations of different types of crypto currencies.
