"Which different categories of crypto currencies can be identified, and what are their characteristics?"

__1. Motivation__

1.1
 
Crypto currencies are getting more and more popular lately and people increasingly start investing in it. This project aims to investigate the different categories of crypto currenties that exist, and their characteristics. As crypto currencies are highly volatile, it is very interesting to investigate their characteristics and how prices of different types of crypto currencies are affected. The dataset will provide users with a clear overview of crypto currency categories, and their specific characteristics. The research question has a high practical relevance, as it provides not only traders but also policy makers with insights on the characteristics of different types of crypto currencies. 

For generating this dataset, multiple relevant websites and API's were considered. Crypto news and Newsdata.io contain articles that are linked to dates, authors and crypto currencies. The data is only refreshed after publications of articles, which makes scraping more difficult. Also, the data on these websites can still be modified after it has been published, which is not the case for Coinmarketcap.com. We therefore choose to use the API of Coinmarketcap.com, where data is refreshed every minute, and which is more user friendly. This API fits our research question best, and provides good insights in the different types of crypto currencies.
